# Pulse: A Real-Time Nightlife Discovery Platform

## Project Overview

**Project Lead:** Davis Kolakowski
## Executive Summary

Pulse is a cutting-edge, location-based platform that revolutionizes how users discover and engage with local nightlife venues. By leveraging real-time data, community-sourced "vibe checks," and AI-driven recommendations, Pulse solves the "Night Out Dilemma" - the challenge of finding the right venue with the right atmosphere at the right time. For venues, Pulse provides a direct channel to reach potential customers at the critical decision-making moment, transforming how local businesses market their offerings and drive foot traffic.

## The Problem

Traditional review and discovery platforms (Yelp, Google Maps, etc.) offer static information that quickly becomes outdated and fails to capture what's happening right now:

- Users can't determine current crowd levels, ambiance, or special events in real-time
- Venues have no effective way to broadcast last-minute events, extended happy hours, or current atmosphere
- A venue's online reputation might not reflect tonight's experience
- Users often make decisions based on outdated information, leading to disappointing experiences

As expressed in our concept documents: "You're not alone – the ambiance of a venue can make or break your night, and traditional apps can't capture the current vibe. The result? Frustration, FOMO, and wasted time wandering from place to place hoping to stumble on the right spot."

## Target Users

Pulse represents a significant opportunity to transform the nightlife discovery experience by bringing real-time, community-driven insights to both users and venues. Our MVP focuses on delivering essential functionality that solves the core "Night Out Dilemma" while establishing a foundation for future growth.

By starting with a PostgreSQL-based recommendation system and focused feature set, we can validate our core value propositions before expanding to more advanced AI capabilities and additional markets. This approach balances innovation with practical implementation constraints while still delivering a compelling product that stands apart from static review platforms.

As stated in our vision: "Pulse is more than just a platform—it's a revolution in how local venues and nightlife enthusiasts connect. By harnessing real‑time data, AI‑powered insights, and a community‑driven approach, Pulse transforms traditional marketing and review systems into a dynamic, interactive experience that benefits both venues and users."
