# Pulse: A Real-Time Nightlife Discovery Platform

## Project Overview

**Project Lead:** Davis Kolakowski

## Executive Summary

Pulse is a cutting-edge, location-based platform that revolutionizes how users discover and engage with local nightlife venues. By leveraging real-time data, community-sourced "vibe checks," and AI-driven recommendations, Pulse solves the "Night Out Dilemma" - the challenge of finding the right venue with the right atmosphere at the right time. For venues, Pulse provides a direct channel to reach potential customers at the critical decision-making moment, transforming how local businesses market their offerings and drive foot traffic.

## The Problem

Traditional review and discovery platforms (Yelp, Google Maps, etc.) offer static information that quickly becomes outdated and fails to capture what's happening right now:

- Users can't determine current crowd levels, ambiance, or special events in real-time
- Venues have no effective way to broadcast last-minute events, extended happy hours, or current atmosphere
- A venue's online reputation might not reflect tonight's experience
- Users often make decisions based on outdated information, leading to disappointing experiences

As expressed in our concept documents: "You're not alone – the ambiance of a venue can make or break your night, and traditional apps can't capture the current vibe. The result? Frustration, FOMO, and wasted time wandering from place to place hoping to stumble on the right spot."

## Target Users

1. **Consumers (21+):**
    - Night-crawlers and social explorers
    - Foodies and drink enthusiasts
    - Live music and entertainment seekers
    - Young professionals looking for quality social experiences
2. **Venues:**
    - Small independent bars and restaurants
    - Cafés and lounges
    - Live music venues
    - Any establishment looking to increase foot traffic and engagement

## Core Value Propositions

- Community-sourced "vibe checks" providing authentic snapshots

### For Venues:

- Direct communication channel to potential customers at decision time
- Real-time broadcasting of events, specials, and atmosphere changes
- Analytics on user engagement and conversion

      - **Tag Trends:** Popular tags appear in a "Trending" section for quick discovery
      - **Tag Search:** Users can search directly for specific tags
